# Multiple Linear Regression

Multiple linear regression (MLR), also known simply as multiple regression, is a statistical technique that uses several explanatory variables to predict the outcome of a response variable. Multiple regression is an extension of linear (OLS) regression that uses just one explanatory variable.

## Multiple linear regression examples.

             * Descriptive statistics;
             * Scatter plot;
             * Correlation;
             * Parameter estimation:
             * Multicollinearity;
             * Test reset;
             * Likelihood Ratio Test;
             * Final model.
